      <h2> Synopsis </h2>
      <p>"The Greatest Showman" is a striking and original musical that celebrates the discovery of show business through a circus. It teaches everyone to celebrate their differnces that society won't accept. Inspired by the ambition and imagination of P.T. Barnum, The Greatest Showman tells the story of an imaginative young boy who rose from nothing to create a mesmerizing show that became a worldwide sensation, giving him and his family everything he had once promised. Embedded in this are stories of love, growth and acceptance. This musical about the life of an entrepreneur P.T Barnum(Hugh Jackman) depicts how he found fame and fortune by starting a circus in the 1870's America. The Greatest Showman posits Barnum as the creator of the modern show business, and a man who believed in celebrating those who are different instead of scorning them. Zac Efron, Michelle Williams,Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson co-star. Directed by Michael Gracey. </p>
