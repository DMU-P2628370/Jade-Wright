    <p> Here is an audio file i found, it's the one i liked most off the free sound website lol <p>

     <!-- ***
          As with the image, these audio files need to be uploaded to GitHub. Your URL tells the browser
          where to find the file. In these cases, it'll be looking for a folder called Multimedia Atom Lab Session in 
          your GitHub repository alongside this HTML file.
          *** -->
<audio controls="true">
    <source scr="Multimedia Atom Lab Session/Audio/audioFile.mpeg" type="audio/mp3"/>
    <source scr="Multimedia Atom Lab Session/Audio/audioFile.wav" type="audio/wav"/>
    <source scr="Multimedia Atom Lab Session/Audio/audioFile.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>
  <p> Sorry your browser does not support the audio element. However you can download an MP3 <a href= "Multimedia Atom Lab Session/Audio/audioFile.mp3">here</a>,</p>

  <!--Im not too sure why my audio file says 0.00 seconds when i load this on a web browser-->
    <!-- ***
         Aha, because it can't find the files.
